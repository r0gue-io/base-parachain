# Assets Parachain Template

A new [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/cumulus)-based Substrate node, configured with fungible and non-fungilble asset functionalities, including asset fractionalization.

This project is a fork of the [Base Parachain Template](https://github.com/r0gue-io/base-parachain).

It is used to generate parachains using [Pop CLI](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli), an all-in-one tool for Polkadot development.
